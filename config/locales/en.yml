      <p>This online engagement platform aims to give as many people as possible the opportunity to think about the future of the city or institution that, together with CitizenLab, has set up this platform. These contributions are subject to a number of rules to keep the debate open and constructive. Below you can find the general conditions of our platform, as we are convinced that clear rules provide the best guarantee for a constructive online community.</p>
      <p>Because CitizenLab appreciates the feedback of the users of their platform, your ideas are welcomed to further improve the platform. You can forward your suggestions to support@citizenlab.co.</p>
      <h2>Who can register on the online engagement platform?</h2>
      <p>Anyone who wants to, can follow the debate online. Everyone can read the submitted ideas and reactions. If you want to participate in the debate yourself (sharing your own ideas, responding to other ideas or supporting existing contributions), you have to create an account. Only registered participants can make an active contribution to the online ideas platform.</p>
      <p>You can register via your e-mail address or create an account by simply linking it to your Facebook or Google profile.</p>
      <p>The creation of an account by a user does not give this user ownership over the account. CitizenLab reserves the right to refuse, suspend or delete accounts, for example if the user does not comply with the following rules or has previously been denied or removed from this user's account.</p>
      <p>Each account must comply with the following rules:</p>
      <h3>Every account is strictly personal</h3>
      <p>Each account must be unique and linked to a natural person. Every user has the right to create one account. If it is determined that one person has multiple accounts, CitizenLab reserves the right to delete all these accounts. Every user must have reached at least the age of 16 years.</p>
      <h3>An account cannot be transferred to another person</h3>
      <p>Since each account is strictly linked to one specific person, this account cannot be transferred to another person without the permission of CitizenLab. This transfer ban must be considered in the broadest sense. CitizenLab reserves the right to refuse or delete this account in case of infringements.</p>
      <p>An account cannot be used for commercial purposes. The CitizenLab platform is intended to increase participation. An account can therefore only be used in that sense. Any use of the account for the sole purpose of enjoying a commercial advantage is prohibited.</p>
      <h3>The account information must always remain confidential</h3>
      <p>It is not allowed for another person than the actual person who created the account, to use this account. The person who creates the account must ensure that (s)he keeps the password and login details. We advise you to use a "strong" password (a password with a combination of lowercase, uppercase letters and numbers). CitizenLab can under no circumstances be held responsible for any loss or damage incurred to the account if the above conditions are not met by the user. CitizenLab cannot be held responsible for theft of your account, for example by 'phishing', either. CitizenLab will never ask its users for personal data such as a login or password via e-mail. If personal data is requested, the user will always be redirected to the platform of CitizenLab.</p>
      <h2>Limitations to content and use of the platform</h2>
      <p>To ensure that the CitizenLab platform is working properly and that you can communicate and connect with others, there are some restrictions on the type of content that can be published via the platform:</p>
      <h3>Offensive behaviour:</h3>
      <p>We firmly believe in freedom of speech. However, in order to ensure that the platform can be used in a constructive way by the users, with respect for different opinions and without people having to be afraid to express their opinions or convictions, we do not allow offensive behaviour that harasses, intimidates or uses fear to silence another user.</p>
      <p>Accounts and related accounts with which the actions below are performed can be temporarily blocked and / or permanently deleted.</p>
      <li>Violent threats (direct or indirect): You may not threaten or promote violence, including the promotion of terrorism.</li> <li>Harassment: You may not incite to or be involved in deliberately insulting or harassing others. Here are some factors that we can take into account when assessing abusive behaviour: whether the main purpose of the reported account is harassing or sending offensive messages to others; whether the reported behaviour is unidirectional or contains threats; whether the reported account encourages others to intimidate another account; and whether the reported account sends intimidating messages to an account from multiple accounts.</li> <li>Hatred: You may not promote violence against other people or directly attack or threaten them on the basis of race, ethnic background, nationality, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, philosophical affiliation, age, disability or illness. We also do not allow accounts whose main purpose is to incite others to do harm on the basis of these categories.</li> <li>Misuse of multiple accounts: Creating multiple accounts for overlapping use to avoid temporary or permanent suspension of an individual account is not allowed.</li> <li>Private data: you may not publish or post confidential data and private information of others without their express authorization and consent. These data include, for example, credit card numbers, address details, telephone numbers or data that constitute the personal privacy of a person.</li> <li>Impersonation: you may not be allowed to enter via the platform if someone else deceives, confuses or threatens in a manner that actually decks or threatens others.</li>
      <h2>Spam</h2>
      <p>We strive at all times to protect the CitizenLab platform user from technical abuse and spam. Accounts in which the actions below are performed can be temporarily blocked or permanently deleted.</p>
      <li>Malware / phishing / viruses / worms / Trojans: You may not post malicious content or links to such content for the purpose of damaging or disrupting someone else's browsers or computers, or of violating someone's privacy.</li> <li>Spam: You cannot use the CitizenLab platform to spam people.</li>
      <h2>Infringement of applicable laws</h2>
      <p>The use of the account may not in any way infringe applicable laws. This includes infringements against privacy legislation, intellectual property rights, the criminal code, etc.</p>
      <p>The account may not be used in any way to promote illegal activities.</p>
      <h2>In case of breaches of the aforementioned rules</h2>
      <p>Citizenlab reserves the right, if it detects infringements on the aforementioned rules, to delete the relevant messages and even suspend or permanently delete user profiles.</p>
      <p>CitizenLab cannot be held liable in any way for messages posted by users or third parties, which violate the above rules. The web administrator will strictly supervise that these rules are not violated. If a user detects an infringement, one can always report this to the following e-mail address: support@citizenlab.co.</p>
      <p>It is possible that files can be downloaded via the platform, whether or not due to a user, or that users place harmful hyperlinks. Every download by a user or click on a hyperlink, placed by a user, is done at their own risk and any damage incurred is completely and solely the responsibility of this user.</p>
      <h2>Intellectual property rights</h2>
      <p>CitizenLab respects the intellectual property rights of others and expects that users of this platform also respect these rights. CitizenLab reserves the right to remove content that infringes intellectual property rights. Repeated infringements of intellectual property rights of any kind by a user will give rise to the suspension or removal of the account by CitizenLab.</p>
      <p>Infringements against intellectual property rights can be reported via the following e-mail address: support@citizenlab.co</p>
      <h2>Property rights CitizenLab</h2>
      <p>CitizenLab's platform is protected by intellectual property rights that relate to content, source code, database, etc. The use of this platform in no way means a transfer of these intellectual rights to the users of the platform.

      <h2>What are citizen initiatives?</h2>
      <p>Citizen initiatives are initiatives that start from the bottom-up, that originate from a need, desire, dream, ... envisioned by you or other citizens. You and the other initiators want to change or improve a current situation or start something from scratch.</p>
      <p>What sets citizen initiatives apart is that they follow some rule-based system and that it includes the involvement of your (local) government. The rule-based system, often formalised in legislation, indicates the conditions that need to be met to get the (local) government officially involved. This involvement is needed for citizen initiatives to reach their objective, think of a city's permission for a temporary usage of a public space, support by city experts to implement your plans, ...</p>
      <p>Citizen initiatives never work in the personal interest, but always in the collective interest.</p>
      <h2>Why would you start one here?</h2>
      <p>This is the official participation platform of $|orgName|, which offers following advantages:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>$|orgName| is already present and actively listening to what's happening on the platform. So no need to find and reach out to relevant people within $|orgName|'s organisation.</li>
         <li>This platform is made specifically for participative actions such as citizen initiatives. All elements, the flow, ... are all built to optimise for this exact objective, which is far from being the case with classical 'social media'.</li>
         <li>Other citizens are already on here, increasing the potential reach to gather support for your initiative.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>What steps to take?</h2>
      <p><strong>1. Check if your initiative fits $|orgName|'s criteria</strong></p>
      <p>$|initiativesEligibilityCriteria|</p>
      <p><strong>2. Check whether what $|orgName| offers will help you reach your objective</strong></p>
      <p>$|initiativesThresholdReachedMessage|</p>
      <p><strong>3. Prepare your initiative with the other citizens involved</strong></p>
      <p>As soon as you publish your initiative on this platform, the timer starts to run. Therefore, it is important to be well prepared when you write your initiative out. On <a href="/initiatives/new" target="_blank">this page</a> you can discover what information will be requested before publishing your initiative.</p>
      <p><strong>4. Publish your initiative</strong></p>
      <p>Publish your initiative on <a href="/initiatives/new" target="_blank">here</a>. Once you hit the 'Publish your initiative' button, it will be visible to all other citizens and the timer will start to run.</p>
      <p><strong>5. Gather support to reach the threshold on time</strong></p>
      <p>Now that your initiative is published, it is time to gather support for it. Make sure to gather $|initiativesVotingThreshold| votes in $|initiativesDaysLimit| days to obtain involvement of $|orgName|. For this, you can use the sharing options on the platform, or all other tools and channels you may think of.</p>

    initiatives_success_1_title: River Shuttle
    initiatives_success_1_body: >
      <p><em>Liège (BE)</em></p>
      <p><strong>Topic: Mobility</strong></p>
      <p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/citizenlabco/image/upload/v1566228019/8a1ebc8b-ab5e-40e2-9cfb-872f8ef28f3e_kxh3fv.jpg"></p>
      <h2>How it started</h2>
      <p>Liège, one of Belgium's biggest cities, opened up their participation platform to crowdsource input for their 'City Plan', a multi-annual strategic plan containing policy priorities for the city.</p>
      <p>After an open call for ideas, the city regrouped these ideas in bigger thematic clusters. The 'River Shuttle' initiative started from one of these clusters and was opened up for voting to all inhabitants.</p>
      <p>Over 15% of Liège's 200,000 inhabitants browsed the platform and casted their votes.</p>
      <h2>The project</h2>
      <p>Liège successfully already used a river shuttle service for touristic purposes during 2 summer seasons, allowing tourists to discover the city from the Meuse river. This inspired at least 9 citizens to give input on how they thought this service could be improved and expanded. What they had in common was:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>the desire to start focusing this shuttle service on commuters too,</li>
          <li>to expand the service from summer only to year-round, and</li>
          <li>to add several stops to the shuttle's trajectory.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Their combined input collected a total of 1336 votes and was regrouped in 1 cluster, further shaped through comments of other citizens.</p>
      <p>The city of Liège listened to this initiative and decided to act upon it. Today, an in-depth study is being done on how the shuttle service can indeed be expanded. The results of this study will be used for future implementation.</p>
      <h2>Succes factors</h2>
      <ul>
          <li>Basis infrastructure present: The implementation of this initiative doesn't need to start from zero. The infrastructure, in this case the biggest cost, is already there, as is the experience with the exploitation and the legal framework.</li>
          <li>Part of wider process: Because this initiative originated in Liège's 'City Plan' process, the citizens behind the initiative benefited from the city-wide communication actions. Also, given the buy-in of decision-makers and the involvement of the city administration, a proper and structured follow-up was guaranteed.</li>
          <li>Linked to widely shared problem: Although the shuttle service suggested in this initiative will never be used by all Liégeois, it does aim to solve a bigger problem that does impact all people living in the city, namely traffic congestion.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How it started</h2>
      <p>Several streets in Schaerbeek have long been unsafe for vulnerable road users. After a fatal traffic accident in July 2017 in the 'zone 30', some citizens decided to take action. </p>
      <h2>The project</h2>
      <p>1030/0 is a citizens' movement that stands up for road safety and better mobility in Schaerbeek. The four main axes of their operation are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Vision Zero: zero kill, zero heavy casualties in traffic.</li>
        <li>Quality of life: a "municipality 30" where the active road user can travel efficiently and safely, but also a municipality with space for meetings and socialising. </li>
        <li>Special attention to the most vulnerable on the road: children, the elderly, people with disabilities.</li>
        <li>Health: improving road safety makes it possible to promote active modes of transport and combat air pollution.</li></ul>
      <p>What they have obtained so far:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Zone 30 obtained.</li>
        <li>Vision Zero was taken over as an official policy line,.</li>
        <li>The municipality has drawn up a strategic road safety note.</li>
        <li>The police bicycle brigade has been (re)established.</li>
        <li>Extra resources for speed control have been freed up,.</li>
        <li>Since 2019, there is a system of 'living streets' established.</li></ul>
      <h2>Succes factors</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Large mobilization: several demonstrations with 60-200 men each.</li>
        <li>Proactive media approach: building good relationships and thinking visually and narratively . Especially on the Flemish side there was already a lot of media attention for the initiative.</li>
        <li>Theme is very popular among the population.</li>
        <li>Perseverance and outdoors: in just one year's time, they organised 20 different actions.</li></ul>
      <h2>Bottlenecks</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Diversity is a working point, not only in terms of origin but also in terms of age. It is being improved through collaborations with local youth centres and non-profits.</li>
        <li>French-speaking media are more difficult to reach.</li></ul>

      <p>This initiative originated from a participatory budgeting project of Wortegem-Petegem. This small Belgian municipality with 6.500 inhabitants, opened up 100.000€ of its budget for crowdsourced initiatives. </p>
      <p>Citizens were invited to share their initiatives on the digital participation platform of Wortegem-Petegem during a two month period. </p>
      <p>After a qualitative selection by the administration, 40 initiatives out of a total of 55 were withheld and opened up to voting by all inhabitants. The voting happened both online and during an offline event in which all initiatives were presented live by their initiators.</p>
      <h2>The project</h2>
      <p>The idea for the initiative is straight-forward: add picnic tables at every playground in Wortegem-Petegem. Not only does this allow (grand-)parents to rest while their (grand-)children are playing, it also allows to meet other people from your municipality in the meantime.</p>
      <p>As it was one of the most popular initiatives in the participatory budgeting project, Wortegem-Petegem decided to implement it. Picnic tables have been installed on 6 locations since.</p>
      <h2>Succes factors</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Clear process and follow-up: Wortegem-Petegem had a clear process worked out before starting to collect citizen initiatives, including collaboration between the different departments. There was also a steady and personal follow-up, to make sure all citizens involved were kept in the loop of steps taken and upcoming plans. And there was the commit to implement all withheld initiatives before the end of the following summer period.</li>
        <li>High level of participation: 14% of the voting population (14 years or older) of Wortegem-Petegem voted on their favourite initiatives.</li>
        <li>This citizen initiative was well-scoped, with a clear finality and limited fixed cost and maintenance costs.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Here, you can start your own idea if it doesn't fit within one of the existing projects.</p><p><strong>The objective?</strong> To get your idea on the political agenda.</p><p><strong>How?</strong> By gathering support, namely at least 100 votes in 3 months. You can do that by first making your idea 'attractive'. Write it in a clear and engaging way, add images, give strong arguments based on facts, add attachments with further details or background information, ... After you've done that, start sharing your idea on social media or through email. Invite people to join the discussion on your idea, or simply convince them to support it by voting in favour.</p><p><a href="/en/projects/open-idea-project/ideas/new" target="_blank"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/citizenlabco/image/upload/v1540212640/image_h6upkl.png" data-align="center" style="display: block;margin:auto;"></a></p><p><strong>About what?</strong> Your idea can be about a lot of things, as long as it is related to your city and its policy. It can be a problem you experience, a solution you envision or even a combination of both. It can be wild and on the long term, or very tangible and a quick win.</p><p><strong>And then? </strong>Did you reach 100 votes in 3 months? Congratulations! The city will now take your idea in consideration. If your idea is considered to be feasible and does not harm specific groups or individuals, you will get the chance to present your proposal during the council meeting. During that same meeting, the council members will give you direct feedback on what they will or won't do with your idea and why. If you don't gather 100 votes in 3 months, your proposal won't be considered.</p><p>We're curious to learn about your ideas!</p>
