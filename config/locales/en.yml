      <p>This online engagement platform aims to give as many people as possible the opportunity to think about the future of the city or institution that, together with CitizenLab, has set up this platform. These contributions are subject to a number of rules to keep the debate open and constructive. Below you can find the general conditions of our platform, as we are convinced that clear rules provide the best guarantee for a constructive online community.</p>
      <p>Because CitizenLab appreciates the feedback of the users of their platform, your ideas are welcomed to further improve the platform. You can forward your suggestions to support@citizenlab.co.</p>
      <h2>Who can register on the online engagement platform?</h2>
      <p>Anyone who wants to, can follow the debate online. Everyone can read the submitted ideas and reactions. If you want to participate in the debate yourself (sharing your own ideas, responding to other ideas or supporting existing contributions), you have to create an account. Only registered participants can make an active contribution to the online ideas platform.</p>
      <p>You can register via your e-mail address or create an account by simply linking it to your Facebook or Google profile.</p>
      <p>The creation of an account by a user does not give this user ownership over the account. CitizenLab reserves the right to refuse, suspend or delete accounts, for example if the user does not comply with the following rules or has previously been denied or removed from this user's account.</p>
      <p>Each account must comply with the following rules:</p>
      <h3>Every account is strictly personal</h3>
      <p>Each account must be unique and linked to a natural person. Every user has the right to create one account. If it is determined that one person has multiple accounts, CitizenLab reserves the right to delete all these accounts. Every user must have reached at least the age of 16 years.</p>
      <h3>An account cannot be transferred to another person</h3>
      <p>Since each account is strictly linked to one specific person, this account cannot be transferred to another person without the permission of CitizenLab. This transfer ban must be considered in the broadest sense. CitizenLab reserves the right to refuse or delete this account in case of infringements.</p>
      <p>An account cannot be used for commercial purposes. The CitizenLab platform is intended to increase participation. An account can therefore only be used in that sense. Any use of the account for the sole purpose of enjoying a commercial advantage is prohibited.</p>
      <h3>The account information must always remain confidential</h3>
      <p>It is not allowed for another person than the actual person who created the account, to use this account. The person who creates the account must ensure that (s)he keeps the password and login details. We advise you to use a "strong" password (a password with a combination of lowercase, uppercase letters and numbers). CitizenLab can under no circumstances be held responsible for any loss or damage incurred to the account if the above conditions are not met by the user. CitizenLab cannot be held responsible for theft of your account, for example by 'phishing', either. CitizenLab will never ask its users for personal data such as a login or password via e-mail. If personal data is requested, the user will always be redirected to the platform of CitizenLab.</p>
      <h2>Limitations to content and use of the platform</h2>
      <p>To ensure that the CitizenLab platform is working properly and that you can communicate and connect with others, there are some restrictions on the type of content that can be published via the platform:</p>
      <h3>Offensive behaviour:</h3>
      <p>We firmly believe in freedom of speech. However, in order to ensure that the platform can be used in a constructive way by the users, with respect for different opinions and without people having to be afraid to express their opinions or convictions, we do not allow offensive behaviour that harasses, intimidates or uses fear to silence another user.</p>
      <p>Accounts and related accounts with which the actions below are performed can be temporarily blocked and / or permanently deleted.</p>
      <li>Violent threats (direct or indirect): You may not threaten or promote violence, including the promotion of terrorism.</li> <li>Harassment: You may not incite to or be involved in deliberately insulting or harassing others. Here are some factors that we can take into account when assessing abusive behaviour: whether the main purpose of the reported account is harassing or sending offensive messages to others; whether the reported behaviour is unidirectional or contains threats; whether the reported account encourages others to intimidate another account; and whether the reported account sends intimidating messages to an account from multiple accounts.</li> <li>Hatred: You may not promote violence against other people or directly attack or threaten them on the basis of race, ethnic background, nationality, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, philosophical affiliation, age, disability or illness. We also do not allow accounts whose main purpose is to incite others to do harm on the basis of these categories.</li> <li>Misuse of multiple accounts: Creating multiple accounts for overlapping use to avoid temporary or permanent suspension of an individual account is not allowed.</li> <li>Private data: you may not publish or post confidential data and private information of others without their express authorization and consent. These data include, for example, credit card numbers, address details, telephone numbers or data that constitute the personal privacy of a person.</li> <li>Impersonation: you may not be allowed to enter via the platform if someone else deceives, confuses or threatens in a manner that actually decks or threatens others.</li>
      <h2>Spam</h2>
      <p>We strive at all times to protect the CitizenLab platform user from technical abuse and spam. Accounts in which the actions below are performed can be temporarily blocked or permanently deleted.</p>
      <li>Malware / phishing / viruses / worms / Trojans: You may not post malicious content or links to such content for the purpose of damaging or disrupting someone else's browsers or computers, or of violating someone's privacy.</li> <li>Spam: You cannot use the CitizenLab platform to spam people.</li>
      <h2>Infringement of applicable laws</h2>
      <p>The use of the account may not in any way infringe applicable laws. This includes infringements against privacy legislation, intellectual property rights, the criminal code, etc.</p>
      <p>The account may not be used in any way to promote illegal activities.</p>
      <h2>In case of breaches of the aforementioned rules</h2>
      <p>Citizenlab reserves the right, if it detects infringements on the aforementioned rules, to delete the relevant messages and even suspend or permanently delete user profiles.</p>
      <p>CitizenLab cannot be held liable in any way for messages posted by users or third parties, which violate the above rules. The web administrator will strictly supervise that these rules are not violated. If a user detects an infringement, one can always report this to the following e-mail address: support@citizenlab.co.</p>
      <p>It is possible that files can be downloaded via the platform, whether or not due to a user, or that users place harmful hyperlinks. Every download by a user or click on a hyperlink, placed by a user, is done at their own risk and any damage incurred is completely and solely the responsibility of this user.</p>
      <h2>Intellectual property rights</h2>
      <p>CitizenLab respects the intellectual property rights of others and expects that users of this platform also respect these rights. CitizenLab reserves the right to remove content that infringes intellectual property rights. Repeated infringements of intellectual property rights of any kind by a user will give rise to the suspension or removal of the account by CitizenLab.</p>
      <p>Infringements against intellectual property rights can be reported via the following e-mail address: support@citizenlab.co</p>
      <h2>Property rights CitizenLab</h2>

      <h2>What are citizen initiatives?</h2>
      <p>Citizen initiatives are initiatives that start from the bottom-up, that originate from a need, desire, dream, ... envisioned by you or other citizens. You and the other initiators want to change or improve a current situation or start something from scratch.</p>
      <p>What sets citizen initiatives apart is that they follow some rule-based system and that it includes the involvement of your (local) government. The rule-based system, often formalised in legislation, indicates the conditions that need to be met to get the (local) government officially involved. This involvement is needed for citizen initiatives to reach their objective, think of a city's permission for a temporary usage of a public space, support by city experts to implement your plans, ...</p>
      <p>Citizen initiatives never work in the personal interest, but always in the collective interest.</p>
      <h2>Why would you start one here?</h2>
      <p>This is the official participation platform of $|orgName|, which offers following advantages:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>$|orgName| is already present and actively listening to what's happening on the platform. So no need to find and reach out to relevant people within $|orgName|'s organisation.</li>
         <li>This platform is made specifically for participative actions such as citizen initiatives. All elements, the flow, ... are all built to optimise for this exact objective, which is far from being the case with classical 'social media'.</li>
         <li>Other citizens are already on here, increasing the potential reach to gather support for your initiative.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>What steps to take?</h2>
      <p><strong>1. Check if your initiative fits $|orgName|'s criteria</strong></p>
      <p>$|initiativesEligibilityCriteria|</p>
      <p><strong>2. Check whether what $|orgName| offers will help you reach your objective</strong></p>
      <p>$|initiativesThresholdReachedMessage|</p>
      <p><strong>3. Prepare your initiative with the other citizens involved</strong></p>
      <p>As soon as you publish your initiative on this platform, the timer starts to run. Therefore, it is important to be well prepared when you write your initiative out. On <a href="/initiatives/new" target="_blank">this page</a> you can discover what information will be requested before publishing your initiative.</p>
      <p><strong>4. Publish your initiative</strong></p>
      <p>Publish your initiative on <a href="/initiatives/new" target="_blank">here</a>. Once you hit the 'Publish your initiative' button, it will be visible to all other citizens and the timer will start to run.</p>
      <p><strong>5. Gather support to reach the threshold on time</strong></p>
      <p>Now that your initiative is published, it is time to gather support for it. Make sure to gather $|initiativesVotingThreshold| votes in $|initiativesDaysLimit| days to obtain involvement of $|orgName|. For this, you can use the sharing options on the platform, or all other tools and channels you may think of.</p>

    initiatives_success_1_title: Loan garden friends
    initiatives_success_1_body: >
      <p><em>Willebroek (BE)</em></p>
      <p><strong>Topic: Social inclusion</strong></p>
      <p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/citizenlabco/image/upload/v1565686136/e061565a-6107-44ae-accf-aec43e3d3c1b_babr9c.jpg" style="border-color: initial;display: block;width: 751px;margin:auto;"></p>
      <h2>How it started</h2>
      <p>During a meeting of 'ATD Vierde Wereld Willebroek' on the theme of sustainability, it was emphasized that several gardens in the vicinity of the social housing estate are neglected, resulting in illegal dumping. This is often due to the fact that people who live there are unable to work on their own garden. In addition, there are a number of people from the apartment blocks who do not have their own garden, but who would like to work in a garden. From there, the idea of "loan gardens" was born that 'links' gardeners without their own garden to people with a garden but who are no longer able to work in it.</p>
      <h2>The project</h2>
      <p>The project of the <strong>loan gardens</strong> started in April 2014 with the gardening of the garden of someone from the group of 'ATD Vierde Wereld Willebroek' who was no longer able to do the gardening herself. Gradually, the initiative was expanded and the Willebroek public library set up a database of loan gardens where potential gardeners can subscribe and find a pace to garden.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Over the years, the Leentuinvrienden have grown into a group of <strong>8 gardeners with about 10 gardens</strong>.</li>
        <li>In addition, vegetables are also shared with people from ATD Vierde Wereld Willebroek and with people who are struggling.</li>
        <li>In the meantime there are also 14 hens under management of which the eggs are shared.</li>
        <li>Residents of social housing can go to De Leentuinvrienden with their vegetable and kitchen waste, which is more ecological and less costly, since residual waste has to be paid for.</li>
        <li>For four years now, they have also been organising an annual summer outing, an annual BBQ and a New Year's reception, where all people associated with De Leentuinvrienden are welcome.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Succes factors</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Collaboration</strong> with the various <strong>municipal services</strong> such as the library, public housing and the community service.</li>
        <li><strong>Collaboration</strong> with the <strong>municipality's meeting house</strong> De Mozaiek, where there is also a pottery and communal garden and where training courses are regularly given in which De Leentuinvrienden can participate. </li>
        <li>Almost every year we could apply for a <strong>subsidy to cover the fixed costs</strong> of De Leentuinvrienden.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Bottlenecks</h2>
      <p>It is not always easy to get rid of the various vegetables grown or to distribute them to the target group (people connected to ATD Vierde Wereld Willebroek). Possible reasons are the unknown of self-preparation of fresh vegetables, the additional cost of preparing fresh vegetables (water consumption, extra gas consumption, ...), but also the logistical aspect of getting fresh vegetables to the end user. We try to bridge this for example by making jam or soup together and distributing it among the participants. Or by using the fresh vegetables as much as possible at the annual BBQ.</p>

      <h2>How it started</h2>
      <p>Several streets in Schaerbeek have long been unsafe for vulnerable road users. After a fatal traffic accident in July 2017 in the 'zone 30', some citizens decided to take action. </p>
      <h2>The project</h2>
      <p>1030/0 is a citizens' movement that stands up for road safety and better mobility in Schaerbeek. The four main axes of their operation are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Vision Zero: zero kill, zero heavy casualties in traffic.</li>
        <li>Quality of life: a "municipality 30" where the active road user can travel efficiently and safely, but also a municipality with space for meetings and socialising. </li>
        <li>Special attention to the most vulnerable on the road: children, the elderly, people with disabilities.</li>
        <li>Health: improving road safety makes it possible to promote active modes of transport and combat air pollution.</li></ul>
      <p>What they have obtained so far:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Zone 30 obtained.</li>
        <li>Vision Zero was taken over as an official policy line,.</li>
        <li>The municipality has drawn up a strategic road safety note.</li>
        <li>The police bicycle brigade has been (re)established.</li>
        <li>Extra resources for speed control have been freed up,.</li>
        <li>Since 2019, there is a system of 'living streets' established.</li></ul>
      <h2>Succes factors</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Large mobilization: several demonstrations with 60-200 men each.</li>
        <li>Proactive media approach: building good relationships and thinking visually and narratively . Especially on the Flemish side there was already a lot of media attention for the initiative.</li>
        <li>Theme is very popular among the population.</li>
        <li>Perseverance and outdoors: in just one year's time, they organised 20 different actions.</li></ul>
      <h2>Bottlenecks</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Diversity is a working point, not only in terms of origin but also in terms of age. It is being improved through collaborations with local youth centres and non-profits.</li>
        <li>French-speaking media are more difficult to reach.</li></ul>

      <h2>The project</h2>
      <p>Tournevie is a non-profit tool lending service in Brussels. It works according to the principle of a library: in exchange for a small annual membership, each member gets access to a wide range of quality tools. This is intended for renovations, repairs and maintenance in the home. The initiative relies on volunteers only. </p>
      <p>The target group consists of occasional users who do not have the need or the money to purchase high-quality material. Tournevie offers them access to such material at a low cost. At the same time, they use the tools more efficiently by sharing it with a large group of members. Tournevie does not focus on the professional market.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>They've set up a non-profit organisation, started a successful crowdfunding campaign and established a tool library and workshop in Anderlecht, near Midi station of the Brussels Region.</li>
        <li>They've also set up an antenna in Elsene, and are planning to do so in other Brussels' municipalities too to ensure that almost everyone can call on a tool lending service in their neighbourhood.</li>
        <li>They have reached more than 1000 members, who have collectively borrowed more than 13,500 tools in the course of 38 months. On average, they process 15 borrowings per opening hour of our lending service.</li>
        <li>Tournevie is an open commons. The community itself manages the tools using a set of transparent rules. Anyone can join them.</li></ul>
      <h2>Succes factors</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>They have launched their initiative with very limited resources (both financially and in terms of raw materials).</li>
        <li>They have focused a lot on communication, first through a crowdfunding campaign, and then in the press and even on television.</li></ul>
      <h2>Bottlenecks</h2>
      <p>Without solid financial resources, it is difficult to afford housing in an attractive, accessible and accessible place. This creates a need for partnerships with organisations or municipal departments that can offer housing. The problem is often that these partnerships are of a temporary nature and that it makes the success of the citizen initiative highly dependent on the goodwill and the whims of others.</p>

    open_idea_project_title: An idea? Bring it to your council!
    open_idea_project_description_preview: Maybe you have an idea that doesn't fit with one of the existing projects? Then post it here, gather support and get it on the political agenda!
    open_idea_project_description: >
      <p>Here, you can start your own idea if it doesn't fit within one of the existing projects.</p><p><strong>The objective?</strong> To get your idea on the political agenda.</p><p><strong>How?</strong> By gathering support, namely at least 100 votes in 3 months. You can do that by first making your idea 'attractive'. Write it in a clear and engaging way, add images, give strong arguments based on facts, add attachments with further details or background information, ... After you've done that, start sharing your idea on social media or through email. Invite people to join the discussion on your idea, or simply convince them to support it by voting in favour.</p><p><a href="/en/projects/open-idea-project/ideas/new" target="_blank"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/citizenlabco/image/upload/v1540212640/image_h6upkl.png" data-align="center" style="display: block;margin:auto;"></a></p><p><strong>About what?</strong> Your idea can be about a lot of things, as long as it is related to your city and its policy. It can be a problem you experience, a solution you envision or even a combination of both. It can be wild and on the long term, or very tangible and a quick win.</p><p><strong>And then? </strong>Did you reach 100 votes in 3 months? Congratulations! The city will now take your idea in consideration. If your idea is considered to be feasible and does not harm specific groups or individuals, you will get the chance to present your proposal during the council meeting. During that same meeting, the council members will give you direct feedback on what they will or won't do with your idea and why. If you don't gather 100 votes in 3 months, your proposal won't be considered.</p><p>We're curious to learn about your ideas!</p>
