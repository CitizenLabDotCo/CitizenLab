# EmailCampaigns

## Models

There are 3 types of e-mail campaigns:

### 1. Triggered

Sending out an email in a triggered campaign is initiated by a user action. 
The receiver is typically one or just a few users.
The content is related to that action and specified by us.

### 2. Recurring

Sending out an email in a recurring campaign is initiated on a fixed recurring time schedule by the backend.
The receiver is typically a larger amount of users.
The content is some kind of digest or curation and is specified by us.

### 3. Manual

Sending out an email in a manual campaign is done when admins or moderators click the send button.
The receiver is a group of users, chosen by the author.
The content is provided by the author.
